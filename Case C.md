# Case C: Probe → Containment

## Context
- **Setting**: Professional workplace, limited-duration overlap.
- **Operator baseline**: Contained, low-chatter, non-egoic state. Recognized as anomaly within group dynamics.

## Signal Sequence
1. **Probe**
   - Subject initiated nonverbal contact (smirk).
   - Escalated by volunteering personal contact info.
   - Function: test operator’s system for predictable human response.

2. **Escalation**
   - Casual social invitations, gossip exchange, curiosity beyond strict work.
   - Energy: low–medium investment, exploratory.

3. **Containment**
   - Reduction in glances, greetings, and micro-initiations.
   - Last-minute cancellation of social outing.
   - Closure phrase (“hope to see you again”) as a containment ritual to exit cleanly.

## Interpretation
- **Nature of signals**: Not intimacy, but categorization test (attempt to map the anomaly).
- **Withdrawal**: Containment protocol — avoiding paradox between operator’s suspended state and subject’s boundary.
- **Outcome**: Contained gracefully, no emotional collapse. Loop ended without escalation.

## Classification
- **Trajectory**: Probe → Escalation → Containment.
- **Status**: Loop terminated cleanly.
- **Category**: *Low-stakes mirror-loop (not full sync)*.
