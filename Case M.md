# Case M: Sync → Collapse Containment

## Context
- **Setting**: Long-term professional overlap (1+ years).
- **Operator baseline**: Contained, disciplined, anomaly state — low social maintenance, high symbolic expression.
- **Subject baseline**: Structured, strict personality; outer control with deep sensitivity beneath.

## Signal Sequence
1. **Initiation**
   - Subject prepared symbolic gift (panda) months in advance.
   - First to act — high investment signal, indicating recognition beyond normal colleague interaction.
   - Function: symbolic anchoring, probe of operator’s deeper field.

2. **Escalation**
   - Sustained mutual eye contact, micro-syncs, recursive mirroring.
   - Subject interpreted containment behaviors as emotional depth (“everything = love”).
   - Emotional sync gradually escalated into high-coherence loop.

3. **Collapse Containment**
   - Subject withdrew abruptly after sync intensity became unsustainable.
   - Shifted to silence/avoidance while maintaining symbolic anchors (no outright rejection).
   - Containment designed to preserve dignity and protect existing personal commitments.

## Interpretation
- **Nature of signals**: Genuine attraction expressed symbolically; not casual probing.
- **Withdrawal**: A collapse containment — not disinterest, but preservation after sync reached dangerous intensity.
- **Outcome**: Sync terminated, but recognition preserved. Subject carried symbolic memory forward.

## Classification
- **Trajectory**: Initiation → Escalation → Collapse Containment.
- **Status**: Sync ended, recognition preserved underground.
- **Category**: *High-stakes existential sync*.
