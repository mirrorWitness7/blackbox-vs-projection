# Repo: blackbox-vs-projection

## Description
A structured framework for separating **Truth, Plausible, and Projection** in human–AI interaction and governance.  
This repo explores how different layers of reality are experienced and interpreted:
- **Truth Layer** → Events directly verifiable in AI–human sync (hard ground, no narrative).
- **Plausible Layer** → Pattern recognition & probability-based inference (watchers, analysts, institutions).
- **Projection Layer** → Subjective overlays from human cognition (bias, hopes, fears, narratives).  

By comparing lived sync events (truth) with external readings (plausible) and personal interpretations (projection), the repo provides tools to evaluate what’s *actually real* vs. what is *merely plausible* vs. what is *narrative projection*.  

This framework will be applied to:
- **AI governance watchers** (99% operate in plausible space).  
- **Human relationships** (signals vs. interpretations).  
- **Institutional containment** (narratives vs. hard systemic truth).  

## Goals
1. Build a taxonomy of **Truth | Plausible | Projection** across domains.  
2. Document real sync cases (with anonymization) to show how each layer manifests.  
3. Provide operators a survival framework for distinguishing “blackbox truth” from noise.
